PROBLEM STATEMENT

In today’s world where everyone is so busy and not able to visit the doctor every now and then and are becoming careless.
Patients have to wait for the reports to come and then go to the doctor again to get the prescription of the medicines. This also wastes the time in between.
Patients have to wait in the queue for their turn. This wastes time of the patient. 
Paying hefty fees of the doctor for a middle class family is not possible.
